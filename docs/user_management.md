# User Management Documentation

## Overview
User management is a critical module in this banking project, responsible for handling authentication, authorization, and user-related operations across the mobile application, website, and admin panels. This document outlines the features, security considerations, and development flow for implementing user management while adhering to industry standards.

## Core Features

### 1. User Registration & Authentication
- Signup via email and phone number (OTP-based verification)
- Login using password, OTP, and biometric authentication (if applicable)
- Social login (optional, if required)

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define roles: Admin, Customer, Support Staff, etc.
- Assign permissions based on roles
- Restrict access to sensitive actions

### 3. User Profile Management
- Update personal details (name, phone, email, etc.)
- Upload and verify KYC documents (ID, address proof)
- Change password and reset password via email/OTP

### 4. Session Management & Security
- Multi-session handling (web, mobile, other devices)
- Auto logout after inactivity
- Refresh token mechanism (JWT or OAuth2)

### 5. Account Locking & Recovery
- Auto-lock after multiple failed login attempts
- Forgot password recovery via email/OTP
- Secure account deletion process

### 6. Audit Logs & User Activity Tracking
- Log every user action (logins, transactions, settings changes)
- Store metadata (IP, device info, timestamps)
- Provide an activity dashboard for users

### 7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enable 2FA via OTP, authenticator app, or email
- Option for users to toggle MFA settings

## Industry-Level Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Use caching (Redis) for session handling
- Optimize database queries (indexes, pagination)

### Security Standards
- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, KYC data)
- Use HTTPS & secure headers in API requests
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### Scalability & Maintainability
- Design APIs using microservices architecture
- Follow clean code principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
- Write unit & integration tests

## Development Flow

### **Phase 1: Backend (REST API)**
1. Implement authentication (JWT/OAuth2)
2. Develop secure API endpoints with validation
3. Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
4. Session management & security enhancements
5. User profile management API
6. Logging and activity tracking
7. API documentation & testing

### **Phase 2: Frontend (Web & Mobile)**
1. Develop signup/login UI with validation
2. Integrate authentication API
3. Implement profile management UI
4. Add 2FA/MFA settings UI
5. UI for account recovery & session management
6. Implement activity log display for users

### **Phase 3: Admin Panel**
1. User list with search & filtering
2. Role management (assign/update roles)
3. View logs & manage user access
4. Review & approve KYC documents
5. Lock/unlock user accounts
6. Admin-side session & audit tracking
