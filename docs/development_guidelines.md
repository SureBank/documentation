# Development Guidelines

## Code Practices:
- Follow clean code principles.
- Each function should do only one thing.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging.
- Write unit tests for all components.

## Version Control:
- Use feature-based branching.
- Commit messages should be descriptive (e.g., "Add user registration flow").
- No direct commits to `develop` or `main` branches.
