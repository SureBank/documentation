# Branching Strategy

## Branches:
- `main`: Production branch
- `develop`: Development branch
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches

## Process:
1. Create a new branch for each feature.
2. Once completed, raise a pull request for `develop`.
3. PR must be reviewed and approved before merging.

- At least 1 reviewer must approve the PR.
- No direct commits to `develop` or `main`.
