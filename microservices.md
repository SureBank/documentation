# Microservices Architecture

SureBank will adopt a microservices architecture in later stages to improve scalability and performance. The following microservices are planned:

- **Account Service**: Handles account creation, updates, and closures.
- **Transaction Service**: Manages internal and external fund transfers, payments, and deposits.
- **Loan Service**: Manages loan applications, eligibility, and repayments.
- **Notification Service**: Sends real-time alerts and reminders to users.
