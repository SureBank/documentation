# Monolith to Microservices Migration

Initially, SureBank will be built as a monolithic application. The following steps outline how we plan to migrate to a microservices architecture:

1. **Phase 1**: Build a monolithic application with all services in one codebase.
2. **Phase 2**: Extract Account and Transaction services into microservices.
3. **Phase 3**: Separate Loan/Card Services and Notifications.
4. **Phase 4**: Implement inter-service communication using REST APIs.
